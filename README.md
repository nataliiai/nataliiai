## About Me

Though my background is primarily in chemistry & human health fields, I like to code for fun!
Since I learnt coding mostly by myself, my scripts are typically extensively documented, so they are beginner-friendly.

## Contact
I'm always open to connecting, whether to discuss projects and collaborate or just to chat!
Feel free to reach out to me here or through email: nataly.ivanova.24@gmail.com
